                    <p>
                        I am a <i>16-year-old boy</i> with a deep passion for <i>computer programming</i> and a strong
                        aspiration to become a young software engineer. From a young age, I have been captivated by the world of
                        technology and the endless possibilities
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        it offers for problem-solving and innovation. My journey in coding started with languages like
                        <em>C#, Python, and Java.</em> Through self-guided learning and exploration, I have acquired a solid 
                        foundation in these languages and enjoy applying them in
                        development of various projects. The process of creating software that can positively impact people's lives truly fascinates me.

                        challenges and am constantly seeking opportunities
                        to learn and grow as a developer. I am motivated by the idea of contributing to the development of
                        cutting-edge technologies and being part of
                        a collaborative team that pushes the boundaries of innovation.
